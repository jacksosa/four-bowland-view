#### Balustrade

**Date:** 24-Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Glass Balustrade ‚Äì Landing  
**Content:**
> Dear Glen and Stephen,  
> Further to my previous correspondence regarding the glass balustrade on the first-floor landing overlooking the
> entrance hall, I want to make clear that the explanation provided by Lee ‚Äî that the balustrade was stopped short due
> to
> the proximity of the double-height windows ‚Äî is not acceptable.  
> As the attached photos show, the balustrade currently ends one panel away from the wall. This leaves the landing
> looking incomplete, with the balustrade terminating abruptly instead of being finished into the wall with a half post,
> base rail, and handrail. It also creates an inconsistent floor detail: part of the line is defined by an oak base
> rail,
> while the remainder is left as painted flooring, meaning once the final floor covering is fitted two different
> finishes
> will meet along the same edge.  
> Ordinarily, a balcony or landing balustrade of this type would be expected to run the full span for both safety and
> aesthetic reasons. The current arrangement does not achieve that, and I want to ensure the matter is resolved
> properly.  
> To remove any ambiguity, I would like confirmation from the balustrade kit supplier as to whether the system is
> designed to terminate as currently fitted, or whether it should continue full length to the wall. Once that is
> established, I expect a clear plan to be put in place to bring the installation to the correct standard.

#### Tiling Issues

**Date:** ~Aug-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Outstanding Tiling Issues  
**Content:**
> Hi Glen / Stephen,  
> I want to consolidate all the outstanding tiling issues into one record so they can be discussed and resolved going
> forward. Most of these points have been raised previously, with the exception of the newly identified cracked tile in
> the lounge.  
> Outstanding issues are as follows:  
> Stress crack in lounge corner tile  
> A tile in the lounge corner has developed a stress crack (photo attached). This appears to be due to insufficient
> expansion allowance where it was cut tightly around the window/corner.  
> Damaged tiles already reported  
> Two tiles chipped from impact damage and have not been replaced nor repaired by the "magic man", time for this has now
> passed and I will correct the damage myself  
> Incorrect grout colour throughout flooring  
> Flooring grout was supposed to be dark grey to contrast with the light grey tiles. Instead, light grey has been used
> across all floors, contrary to the agreed design.  
> Garage floor gradient  
> The garage floor does not run to the specified drainage gradient. Instead, a weather strip was installed as a
> workaround. While I appreciate this, it does not reflect the cost saving gained from not completing the work as
> specified.  
> Over-calculation of tiling area / lack of spare tiles  
> The wastage uplift was applied across both materials and labour, which is not correct. In addition, despite paying for
> all supplied materials, no spare tiles for either the walls or flooring have been left with me. At present I have none
> to cover future repairs.  
> My expectations  
> At this stage, I am not asking for remedial work to be carried out. However, I do expect:  
> Acknowledgement of the issues listed above,  
> The correct number of spare tiles for both wall and floor tiling to be provided to me, and  
> A suitable compensation arrangement to be proposed in recognition of the defects and the shortfall in what was
> supplied.  
> Please confirm receipt of this email and come back with a proposed arrangement to resolve these matters.

#### Fence Post Caps

**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Fence Post Caps  
**Content:**
> Hi Glen / Stephen,  
> I asked for post caps to be fitted on the 100mm square fence posts to prevent water ingress and rot. Unfortunately,
> what has been installed are cuts of feather edge board that:  
> Do not sit flat on the posts (they‚Äôre warped)  
> Do not cover the full surface area of the post tops  
> Leave gaps underneath where water will be able to sit and soak directly into the end grain  
> This creates exactly the opposite of what post caps are supposed to do ‚Äì instead of shedding water away, they will
> trap it against the timber and accelerate rot. I‚Äôve attached some photos so you can see what was fitted.  
> As the solution provided is not fit for purpose, I‚Äôve now purchased proper post caps (the correct size and design) and
> will fit these myself to make sure the job is done properly.  
> I wanted to bring this to your attention as another example of the poor quality of workmanship that was delivered.
> Using offcuts in this way is not an acceptable substitute for proper caps and undermines the longevity of the fence.

#### Sink Taps and Pipework

**Date:** ~Aug-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Bathroom Sink Taps and Plumbing Issues  
**Content:**
> Hi Glen / Stephen,  
> Further to the snagging list I raised two months ago, I wanted to follow up specifically on the issue with the main
> bathroom sink taps.  
> As you know, these taps have had a small but persistent leak from under the lever, and the mechanism is extremely
> stiff, leaving them essentially unusable. As the matter hasn‚Äôt been addressed yet, I‚Äôve agreed with Glen that I will
> purchase and fit suitable alternatives at my own expense and return the existing units for a full refund.  
> However, in the process of fixing a leak and changing the tap in the downstairs toilet, a more serious concern has
> come to light. The pipework for both the taps and waste has not been securely clipped in place behind the
> plasterboard.
> This lack of fixing means the system is free to move, which will inevitably work joints loose over time and cause
> leaks.  
> In fact, the leak on the P-trap in the downstairs toilet was a direct result of this issue. The downpipe from the sink
> was marginally too long and, instead of being cut to the correct length, the entire arrangement was forced into place.
> This stressed the system, damaged the seal, and it failed once the system was in use under normal water load and
> pressure.  
> I have raised this with Glen on WhatsApp, but I want to capture the issue formally in writing because it has wider
> implications:  
> Based on what I‚Äôve seen, I now suspect this same approach may have been taken with the other four taps, the wall-hung
> bidets and toilets, the two towel radiators in the bathrooms, the two radiators in the garage, and potentially the
> main
> baths.  
> As everything is concealed, I have no reassurance that these installations are satisfactory, and the workmanship
> observed suggests shortcuts may have been taken throughout.  
> The plumber had also stated that all inlet tails to the taps would be isolated at the start of their connection, but
> this is not the case with the downstairs toilet, and I suspect the same applies to the other taps.  
> Given the seriousness of these issues, could you please confirm:
> 1. What steps you propose to take to investigate whether this is a wider problem across the property?
> 2. How you intend to remedy the lack of secure fixing/clipping of the concealed pipework to avoid future leaks?
> 3. Whether you can clarify and rectify the absence of isolation valves at the tap connections, as originally stated?  
     > I need to be confident that the plumbing installations across the house are robust and compliant, and right now
     the evidence points in the opposite direction. I would like your proposals for investigation and remediation before
     I proceed further.

#### Oak Staircases

**Date:** ~Aug-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Oak Staircases ‚Äì Snagging Issues  
**Content:**
> Dear Glen and Stephen,  
> Further to my snagging list and our discussions when I moved into the property two months ago, as you know the issue
> with the oak staircases remains unresolved. As documented, the stairs have sustained ingrained dirt and scratches
> during
> construction due to inadequate protection, and they were not handed over in a new condition.  
> While I understand you may be considering sending a joiner to sand and varnish the affected areas, I am concerned that
> such work, if not carried out by a restoration specialist, risks leaving the stairs with a poor finish that does not
> match their intended ‚Äúas new‚Äù appearance. I have already seen evidence elsewhere in the property (for example, doors
> where oily fingerprints were sealed under varnish) of finishing work being executed without sufficient cleaning or
> preparation, which reinforces these concerns.  
> As you know, there are two staircases in the property:  
> Ground to first floor: this flight has sustained the majority of the damage and does not reflect a new condition.  
> First to second floor: this flight was used far less during the build and, apart from a few minor areas, remains
> largely in the condition that both flights should have been handed over in.  
> This second staircase should therefore be taken as the benchmark for the standard required. Any restoration work
> carried out on the damaged staircase should be assessed against this benchmark, and any compensation for failure to
> achieve that standard should be decided on that basis.  
> Before any remedial action is undertaken, I require:
> 1. A clear written plan setting out how the restoration will be carried out, including cleaning, preparation, and
     finishing steps.
> 2. Confirmation that the work will be undertaken by someone with the appropriate expertise in restoring oak
     staircases, not just general joinery.
> 3. Assurance that the ground-to-first-floor staircase will be restored to the same condition as the
     first-to-second-floor staircase.
> 4. Clarification of what compensation will be provided should the remedial works fail to achieve this standard.  
     > Please treat this as a formal request for resolution under my snagging/defects process. I would be grateful if
     you could respond within 14 days with your proposed course of action.

#### Vent-Axia PIV System

**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Vent-Axia PIV System Installation Concerns  
**Content:**
> Dear Glen and Stephen,  
> I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention some concerns regarding the installation of the
> Vent-Axia Pure Air Home Positive Input Ventilation (240V) system in my loft, as I've noticed a few areas that need
> attention for optimal performance and safety. I've attached a photo to illustrate the issues, and I trust your team
> can
> address these effectively.  
> Based on Vent-Axia guidelines and some research, the unit should be mounted on stilts for proper elevation and
> stability, but it is currently placed on a loose plywood board resting on insulation wool without secure fastening.
> This
> could lead to instability, potential shifting, and risks such as wool compression or fiber release affecting the
> system‚Äôs efficiency. Additionally, the filter bags on either side are crushed and flattened rather than hung
> vertically,
> which may restrict airflow and reduce filtration effectiveness. The wiring also has excess slack and lacks cable ties,
> posing minor safety concerns if left unaddressed.  
> To ensure the system operates as intended, I‚Äôd also like you to check the loft area for correct ventilation, including
> confirming that no other vents (e.g., bathroom or kitchen extractors) are discharging into the space, and ensuring the
> loft is well-ventilated (e.g., via eaves vents or roof tiles) to provide a supply of fresh air. This will help avoid
> introducing contaminants and support the PIV‚Äôs purpose.  
> I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this issue and provide a clear action plan detailing how you intend to
> resolve these points, including:  
> Mounting the unit on stilts or securely fixing the platform to the joists.  
> Repositioning and supporting the filter bags to hang properly and avoid crushing.  
> Tidying the wiring with cable ties and ensuring all connections are secure.  
> Coordinating with Joe, the electrician, to execute the plan when all required materials and resources are in place.  
> Checking and adjusting the loft ventilation as needed.  
> Please include an estimated duration for the work once agreed upon, so I know how long the process will take. I look

**Content:**
> Hi Glen / Stephen,  
> I hope you‚Äôre both well.  
> Following on from my earlier email regarding scheduling and advance notice of tradesmen attending the property, I need
> to raise some concerns and propose a new approach for handling the outstanding internal snagging work.  
> As you know, there are still a number of internal and external items that remain incomplete. Unfortunately, the agreed
> schedules have not been adhered to‚Äîfor example, work due to start last Monday morning didn‚Äôt begin until Tuesday
> afternoon, and again today work was due to commence at 9am but was cancelled at short notice due to a tradesman being
> unavailable. In these cases, no alternative arrangements were made despite the fact that there are other tradespeople
> who could carry out the same type of work.  
> This inconsistency creates a particular problem for me with internal snagging tasks. In order to accommodate these
> visits, I have to make arrangements with my employer, which often means taking holiday (unpaid as a contractor) due to
> the sensitive nature of my work. This costs me ¬£625 per day (rising to ¬£850 from 1st September). I am willing to bear
> this loss where the work is actually carried out, but when it is cancelled or delayed at short notice there are no
> consequences for your team, and I am the one who loses out.  
> It has now been six weeks since I moved in, and given the ongoing uncertainty about when the work will be completed, I
> would like to propose a different approach:  
> No further internal snagging work is to be carried out by your tradesmen.  
> Instead, I ask that you provide all of the required materials to enable me to complete the work myself (or with help
> from friends where necessary).  
> This must include not only the larger items (e.g. mirrors, oak staircase trim), but also consumables such as paint for
> plaster and skirting boards, silicone sealant for plumbing, etc.  
> You should also provide:  
> A comprehensive written list of all outstanding tasks you have recorded.  
> A full list of materials that will be provided to complete these tasks.  
> A date by which these materials will be supplied, so that I can plan accordingly.  
> I will not be charging for the time I spend completing the tasks, but I do need full clarity and commitment from you
> on the above so that I can take control of the situation and bring matters to a close.  
> Please confirm your agreement to this approach and provide the required lists and timelines.

> By the way, regarding the taps, if it's decided they need to be changed, I believe these would be the best

> sink due to the shallow outlet angle:  
> https://www.blackburnplumbers.co.uk/p169694/RAK-RESORT-STANDARD-BASIN-MIXER/  
> Just to update you on some of the snags:  
> Due to the B4RN installation, the skirting board in the understairs cupboard was removed. This needs to be replaced,
> and some touch-up paint will be required to cover the missing spots.  
> The high winds today have caused the anti-slip matting down to the stream to move in several locations. It looks like
> more steel pins will be required along the sides of the matting to prevent the wind from getting underneath and
> blowing
> it loose.  
> Additionally, the paintwork in the downstairs toilet needs touching up on the wall and skirting where the leaked water
> has run. It has actually been taken back to the plaster directly under the sink in a thin line. This was likely due to
> the tap having a small drip leak from the top mixer, which then dripped into the sink and waste, and then out onto the
> wall and ran down. I have closed the plug in the sink to accumulate the water there instead of down the trap, and
> everything has dried out okay now.  
> I have also carried out the work for the wine cooler appliance by clearing out all the debris from under the
> appliance, leveling the unit, and fixing the bent cooling grill at the bottom of the unit. You can update this one to
> completed.  
> Besides the inspection on Thursday and the work carried out today by Beccy & Mark around the heat pump soak-away, is

**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Update on Garage Radiators and Fireplace  
**Content:**
> Hi Both,  
> Just a quick update on the garage rads and heat pump unit. After the second test I was able to isolate and bleed the

#### Garage Radiators and Heat Pump Leak

**Date:** 24-Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** RE: Garage Rad's & Heat Pump Leak  
**Content:**
> Good morning both,  
> I wanted to provide an update on the installation of the garage radiators and a potential leak with the heat pump. The
> garage radiators were installed yesterday afternoon. After the installation, the heating for one of the downstairs
> zones
> was turned on to test the system. The radiators did receive some heat, but only the bottom of the radiators became
> lukewarm, and they did not emit significant heat like the towel radiators in the bathrooms do. This morning, I plan to
> repeat the test with the bathroom radiators turned off to isolate the garage system and see if that improves the heat
> output.  
> Also, during the testing yesterday, I noticed what appears to be a leak from the left-hand side mount of the heat
> pump. I am unsure when the leak started, but I took a photo around 4 pm. Given that the heating engineers were there
> to
> install the garage radiators and fill the system with antifreeze solution, the leak might be related to their work,
> but
> I cannot be certain. This morning, the pooling of liquid is less apparent; however, it rained overnight and the system
> has not been on. It is possible that the leak was just an overspill or release after the system was re-pressurized. I
> will monitor the situation this morning to see if the leak reoccurs when the heat pump is operating at full
> capacity.

#### Additional Snags and Updates

**Date:** ~Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen  
**Subject:** Snag Additions and Updates  
**Content:**
> Good Morning Glen,  
> I hope you had a good weekend. I have a few additions and updates on existing snags from this weekend after having
> some time to look into things more deeply.  
> Snags:
> - Missing O-ring on the outdoor light by the utility room external door, discovered after cleaning and ensuring all
    water had been removed from the jet washing.
> - Damaged tile in the main bathroom behind the radiator. It looks like the soldering of the pipework and the heat/flux
    being blown onto the tile caused a rough, discolored surface.
> - Random nail or screw sticking out of the wall in the garage, located on the right-hand side of the main folding
    garage door at the height of the top section and painted white. It doesn't seem to serve any purpose, but I might be
    wrong.
> - Two incorrectly drilled light fitting holes in the garage ceiling are still visible. This might be addressed after
    painting is finished but needs checking.
> - Master Ensuite Bathroom Xpelair unit seems louder than the others. This might relate to the wiring issue I
    highlighted when the lights come on, increasing the current when it shouldn't, or an issue with how the system has
    been wired up.  
    > Updates:
> - I have "fixed" the drainage issue with the showers. It was related to the incorrect fitting of the drainage traps
    and also builders' debris not being cleared from them after fitting. It might be worth checking and cleaning these
    as part of the pre-handover cleaning tasks since this area is often overlooked and, if not addressed, has the
    potential to cause significant water damage to the property.
> - The thermostat in the garage looks to have been tightened up. I think Jo must have done this when they were checking
    the system the other week after it went off. However, the plaster could do with a bit of a clean-up. Sand and paint
    should be all that's required.
> - I went around all the windows and doors at the rear of the property with a soft brush to remove some of the surface
    sand, but a lot of it looks to be deep-rooted and visible from the internal view. This sand has been blasted into
    the window seals during the jet washing process. It might be worth checking with the window suppliers as part of the
    builders' warranty work the effects of this deep sand ingestion on the warranty and the life of the seals.

#### Toilet Seats

**Date:** ~Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen  
**Subject:** Toilet Seat Issues  
**Content:**
> Hi Glen,  
> I have found this small issue with the toilet seats, initially I thought they were just loose and needed tightening up
> but when I checked the fittings, they were fine.  
> What I have found is that the two contact pads at the rear of the seat are lifted up from the base and as a result,
> the seat can rock from side to side giving an unstable platform.  
> I have tried to take a photo of the issue to show you, and I have attached it to this email. It's a strange one as the
> seats in all other areas look like they have been designed with the base in mind so wouldn't have expected this
> problem.  
> From what I can tell, the issue looks to stem from the height set by the back quick release pins, so maybe they have
> different sizes that can be used to adjust this height so that all four pads engage correctly? Maybe you can check
> this
> with the supplier?  
> Hopefully all that makes sense, but let me know if you require any additional detail.  
> Regards,

#### Miscellaneous Snags

**Date:** ~Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Additional Snags  
**Content:**
> Hi Glen and Stephen,  
> I've identified a few additional snags around the property during recent checks and wanted to consolidate them here
> for your records:
> - **Slow toilet refill and bidet poles**: The top floor toilet has a notably slow tank refill rate, which affects
    usability. Additionally, the steel hanging poles under the bidets have an unclear function‚Äîplease confirm if these
    are necessary or should be removed.
> - **Crack in master bedroom floor**: A visible crack has appeared in the flooring, which needs inspection to determine
    the cause and resolution.
> - **Inconsistent blanking plates**: The bathroom blanking plates should all be brushed steel to match the design
    specification, but some are different finishes, creating an aesthetic inconsistency.
> - **Unfinished toilet flush mechanisms**: The lower floor toilet flush valves show visible black plastic when pressed,
    unlike the top floor, which has a finished appearance. This needs correction to match the agreed standard.
> - **TV mount advice**: I‚Äôd like advice on safely mounting a TV in the front room, including structural support and
    concealed cabling options to maintain aesthetics.
> - **Sand piles around house**: There‚Äôs noticeable sand accumulation around the stone edges, likely from jet washing,
    which needs clearing to prevent drainage issues.
> - **Balcony floor sand**: The balcony has excessive sand residue, also from jet washing, requiring thorough cleaning.
> - **Missing edge on back door sill**: The rear garage door‚Äôs bottom sill lacks edge capping, which is needed for
    weather protection.  
    > Please confirm receipt and let me know how you plan to address these items. I‚Äôd appreciate a timeline for
    inspection and resolution.

#### Stonework Damage from Jet Washing

**Date:** 07-Jul-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Urgent: Stonework Damage from Jet Washing  
**Content:**
> Dear Glen and Stephen,  
> I am writing to formally raise a significant concern regarding damage to the external stonework at 4 Bowland View
> caused by jet washing. The process has resulted in visible surface erosion, scour marks, and exposed aggregates across
> multiple areas, particularly around the rear windows, doors, and lower brickwork. This damage not only affects the
> aesthetic appearance but also risks accelerating weathering and compromising the stonework‚Äôs longevity.  
> I have spent several hours attempting to clean up the sand and debris left behind, but the underlying damage to the
> stone surface remains evident. I am particularly concerned about the potential long-term impact on the structural
> integrity and warranty of the affected areas.  
> I request the following actions:
> 1. A specialist inspection to assess the extent of the damage and confirm whether the stonework‚Äôs condition aligns
     with the expected standard for a new-build property.
> 2. A detailed rectification plan to restore the stonework to its intended condition, including any necessary repairs
     or replacements.
> 3. Clarification on whether this damage affects the warranty provided by the stone supplier or builder, and what steps
     will be taken to mitigate this.
> 4. A proposal for compensation if the damage cannot be fully rectified, given the time and effort I‚Äôve already
     invested in cleaning up the residue.  
     > Please acknowledge receipt of this email within 48 hours and provide a timeline for the inspection and proposed
     next steps. This issue is of high priority due to its impact on the property‚Äôs external appearance and
     durability.

#### Clarification Required ‚Äì Missing Warm Roof Insulation at Ridge

**Date:** 29-Aug-2025  
**To:** Glen & Stephen  
**Subject:** Clarification Required ‚Äì Missing Warm Roof Insulation at Ridge  
**Content:**
> Dear Glen & Stephen,  
> During recent inspection of the roof space in my house, I noticed that no PIR insulation has been installed across the
> ridge ‚ÄúV‚Äù section at the top of the roof. The uninsulated area extends the full width of the house and approximately 1
> metre down either side, which is a significant gap in coverage.  
> As the specification and extras I paid for clearly state a warm roof system with 100 mm PIR below rafters (126 m¬≤),
> the roof should have been constructed with a continuous insulation envelope across the entire pitched roof, including
> right up to and across the ridge. This is the accepted industry standard for a warm roof build-up. The omission of PIR
> boards at the ridge not only breaks this envelope but also suggests a departure from good workmanship.  
> On closer inspection it appears loft roll insulation has been fitted below the ridge in place of PIR boards. Please
> confirm if this is the case. My understanding is that loft roll is not an acceptable substitute for the specified 100
> mm
> PIR, as it provides lower thermal resistance, does not form a continuous vapour control layer, and undermines both the
> warm roof strategy and the operation of the PIV system. This would therefore not meet the agreed specification.  
> Given the roof construction, I very much doubt that any continuous insulation layer could have been installed above
> the rafters at ridge level, as this would interfere directly with the roof tiles. Please therefore confirm on what
> basis
> the omission of PIR boards at the ridge was allowed, and how compliance with the warm roof specification was
> supposedly
> achieved.  
> Please can you:
> 1. Provide the approved roof/ridge construction detail and U-value/SAP calculations that show how this build-up
     achieves compliance.
> 2. Clarify whether this installation is in line with the agreed specification, or if an omission/substitution has
     occurred.
> 3. If incomplete or non-compliant, confirm when PIR insulation will be installed across the ridge to maintain
     continuity and performance.  
     > As this relates directly to the ¬£3,200 paid for the warm roof upgrade, I must also reserve my position regarding
     recovery of this cost should it turn out that the specification has not been met.  
     > While I accept minor snagging is part of handover, this issue appears to be a major omission from the agreed
     specification, rather than a routine defect. As such, any time and disruption required to investigate, document,
     and coordinate the correction of this work should not have been necessary and I consider it reasonable to seek
     compensation for the impact this has caused.  
     > I have taken photos of the exposed area which I can share if useful. I would appreciate your clarification as
     soon as possible.  
     > Best regards,  
     > Samuel Jackson
